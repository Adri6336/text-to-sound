This is a cipher that converts a message into sound and sheet music. It does not otherwise mess with the info: it legit only converts it to sound, with the pitch frequency representing the ordinal value of the message's characters.

In addition to the requirements listed in the requirements.txt, text-to-sound needs the following installed:
  - FluidSynth
  - LilyPond
