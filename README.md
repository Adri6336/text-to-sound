# text-to-sound

This is a thing that converts a message into sound and sheet music. It does not otherwise mess with the info: it legit only converts it to sound, with the pitch representing the ordinal value of the message's characters. As of yet, it's one-way; I'm looking into making it decryptable automatically. 
I have made a few attempts to decrypt it but am really quite stuck; I'm starting to think it's legit one-way, kinda like a hash

In addition to the requirements listed in the requirements.txt, text-to-sound needs the following installed:
  - FluidSynth
  - LilyPond
  
 Python 3.10 works best for the requirements
