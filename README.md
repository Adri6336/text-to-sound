# text-to-sound

This is a substitution cipher that converts a message into sound and sheet music. It does not otherwise mess with the info: it legit only converts it to sound, with the pitch representing the ordinal value of the message's characters. As of yet, this cipher is one-way; I'm looking into making it decryptable automatically.

In addition to the requirements listed in the requirements.txt, text-to-sound needs the following installed:
  - FluidSynth
  - LilyPond
  
 Python 3.10 works best for the requirements
